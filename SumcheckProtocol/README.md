# SumcheckProtocol

The **sumcheck protocol** in [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/), built on
[`CMvPolynomial`](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/CompPoly).

```lean
import SumcheckProtocol
```

## Key features

- **Fully computable**: transcript generation is provided given a
  [`CMvPolynomial`](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/CompPoly), a
  claim, and a challenge set.
- **Formalized theorems**: `completeness` and `soundness` are
  machine-checked.
- **Inner-product sumcheck**
  ([`SumcheckProtocol/IP/InnerProduct.lean`](IP/InnerProduct.lean)):
  `InnerProductStatement` claiming `c = Σ f(x)·g(x)` over a boolean
  hypercube (or other domain), reduced to sumcheck on `f * g`.
  Completeness, soundness, and a multilinear soundness-error bound of
  `n · 2 / |𝔽|`.

## Theorems

### Completeness

> If the prover is honest, the verifier always accepts.

```lean
theorem perfect_completeness
  {𝔽 : Type _} {n : ℕ}
  [Field 𝔽] [Fintype 𝔽] [DecidableEq 𝔽]
  (p : CPoly.CMvPolynomial n 𝔽) :
  prob_over_challenges
    (fun r => AcceptsEvent p (generate_honest_transcript p (honest_claim p) r))
  = 1
```

Given a multivariate polynomial $p : \mathbb{F}[X_1, \dots, X_n]$ and
an honest prover who sets

$$c_0 = \sum_{b \in \\{0,1\\}^n} p(b)$$

the verifier accepts with probability exactly 1 over all challenge
tuples $r \in \mathbb{F}^n$.

### Soundness

> If the claim is false, the verifier accepts with low probability.

```lean
theorem soundness_dishonest
  {𝔽 : Type _} {n : ℕ}
  [Field 𝔽] [Fintype 𝔽] [DecidableEq 𝔽]
  (claim : 𝔽)
  (claim_p : CPoly.CMvPolynomial n 𝔽)
  (adv : Adversary 𝔽 n)
  (h : claim ≠ honest_claim (p := claim_p)) :
  prob_over_challenges (E := AcceptsOnChallenges claim claim_p adv)
    ≤ n * (max_ind_degree claim_p) / field_size
```

If a prover claims a value $c \neq \sum_{b \in \\{0,1\\}^n} p(b)$, then
for any strategy, the probability the verifier accepts is bounded by

$$\Pr[\text{accept}] \leq \frac{n \cdot d}{|\mathbb{F}|}$$

where $d = \max_i \deg_{X_i}(p)$ is the max individual degree of $p$.
The proof sketch is:

1. **Reduction**: a dishonest claim implies at least one "bad" round
   where the prover's polynomial $\neq$ honest one.
2. **Union bound**: the acceptance probability is bounded by the sum
   over rounds.
3. **Schwartz–Zippel**: at each bad round, the probability of the
   verifier's random challenge hitting a root of the difference
   polynomial is at most $d / |\mathbb{F}|$ (via Mathlib's
   `MvPolynomial.schwartz_zippel_sum_degreeOf`).

## Honest prover

The honest prover message at round $i$ is defined as the
**univariate polynomial** in $X_i$ computed by summing out the
remaining variables over the Boolean hypercube:

$$g_i(X_i) = \sum_{b \in \\{0,1\\}^{n-i-1}} p(r_1, \dots, r_{i-1}, X_i, b_1, \dots, b_{n-i-1})$$

where $r_1, \dots, r_{i-1}$ are the verifier's previous challenges.
This is implemented in [`Src/Prover.lean`](Src/Prover.lean) as
`honest_prover_message_at`, which:

1. Builds a **substitution map** `Fin n → CMvPolynomial 1 𝔽` that
   replaces the first $i$ variables with constants (the challenges),
   the $(i{+}1)$-th variable with the indeterminate $X_0$, and the
   remaining variables with hypercube bits.
2. Evaluates $p$ under this substitution via `eval₂Poly`, producing a
   univariate polynomial.
3. **Sums** these univariates over all $\\{0,1\\}^{n-i-1}$
   assignments using `sum_over_hypercube_recursive`.
